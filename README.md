  * [Search](Search.png) - User can search for books via the Google Books API and render them here. User has the option to "View" a book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Save" a book, saving it to the Mongo database.

  * [Saved](Saved.png) - Renders all books saved to the Mongo database. User has an option to "View" the book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Delete" a book, removing it from the Mongo database.

* `title` - Title of the book from the Google Books API  ### Collections - each document is a book 

* `authors` - The books's author(s) as returned from the Google Books API

* `description` - The book's description as returned from the Google Books API

* `image` - The Book's thumbnail image as returned from the Google Books API

      description: "Set in a dark vision of the near future, a terrifying reality TV show is taking place. Twelve boys and twelve girls are forced to appear in a live event called The Hunger Games. There is only one rule: kill or be killed. When sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen steps forward to take her younger sister's place in the games, she sees it as a death sentence. But Katniss has been close to death before. For her, survival is second nature."
